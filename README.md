Today your terminal, tomorrow the world!


Installation on GNU/Linux (or other Unix implementations)
---------------------------------------------------------

[Download](/erkin/ponysay/downloads) or clone the project.
In the terminal, `cd` into the ponysay directory and `./setup.py --freedom=partial install` or `python3 setup.py --freedom=partial install`.
You may need to be super user to run `./setup.py --freedom=partial install` without `--private`, on most systems this
can be achieved by running `sudo ./setup.py --freedom=partial install`.
If you only want completely free ponies install use `--freedom=strict` instead of `--freedom=partial`.
For more information we have provided you with an extensive [manual in PDF](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/blob/master/ponysay.pdf?raw=true).

In order to use ponysay, run:

    ponysay "I am just the cutest pony!"
    
Or if you have a specific pony in your mind:

    ponysay -f pinkie "Partay!~"

Run `info ponysay`, `man 6 ponysay` or `ponysay -h` for more information.
A Spanish manual is available: `man -L es 6 ponysay`.

#### Arch Linux
The package is in the official repositories as `community/ponysay`, there is also a git version named `ponysay-git` in AUR.

#### Chakra
A git version of the package is available as `ponysay-git` in CCR, alongside a stable package as `ponysay`.

#### Gentoo Linux
There is a package for Gentoo, to make installation and keeping it up to date easy. You can find it in [this overlay](https://github.com/etu/aidstu-overlay). The package is named `games-misc/ponysay`.

#### Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu
The DEB file can be found in this PPA [here](https://launchpad.net/~vincent-c/+archive/ppa).

### Pony fortune on terminal startup 

This requires that you have the `fortune` utility installed. You can install it from your repositories (may be named `fortune-mod`)
or just fetch the source code from [here](ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/games/amusements/fortune/).

You can try [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlelinux/comments/srixi/using_ponysay_with_a_ponified_fortune_warning/) script or
[ponypipe](/maandree/ponypipe) to ponify fortunes.

Edit your `~/.bashrc` and add this to the end of the file

    fortune | ponysay

Now every time you open a terminal a pony should give your fortune

### Pony quotes

Running `ponysay --q` will give you a random pony saying one it its quote from MLP:FiM, or you can specify the pony: `ponysay -q pinkie`.
Just as with `-f`, `-q` can be used multiple time to to sepecify a set of ponies from which one will be selected randomly.

When running `ponysay -l` or `ponysay -L` the ponies which have quotes will be printed bold or bright (depending on terminal).

### Ponies in TTY (Linux VT)

If you have a custom colour palette edit your `~/.bashrc` and add

    if [ "$TERM" = "linux" ]; then
        function ponysay
        {
            exec ponysay "$@"
            #RESET PALETTE HERE
        }
    fi

FAQ
---

__Q:__ The output looks like a mess in _(TTY/PuTTY/other)_!

__A:__ Unfortunately we cannot make it perfect, see [issue 1](//github.com/erkin/ponysay/issues/1). But we have done a lot, read more about how to get the best the current state of the art has to offer in the [manual](//github.com/erkin/ponysay/blob/master/ponysay.pdf?raw=true).

__Q:__ You are missing _(my-favourite-pony)_!

__A:__ [Ask](//github.com/erkin/ponysay/issues) and we'll add!

__Q:__ The outpus look weird on my _(xfce4-terminal/mate-terminal/xterm)_ with _this_ font

__A:__ We use blocks for printing the ponies, if the blocks are misalignated or you not use a __real__ monospaced font with aligned blocks try another monospaced font like 'fixed [misc]' or 'Liberation Mono'.

__Q:__ Which programs do you use to generate the pony files?

__A:__ The pony files are actually mostly a bunch of selected [browser ponies](//web.student.tuwien.ac.at/~e0427417/browser-ponies/ponies.html), converted using [util-say](//github.com/maandree/util-say),
Other are taken from desktop ponies, and finally another are created specificaly for ponysay.

The [PDF manual](//github.com/erkin/ponysay/blob/master/ponysay.pdf?raw=true) should answer most of your questions.
