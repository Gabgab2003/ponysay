      <code>ponysay</code> â€” cowsay reimplemention for ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      ponysay as an awesome program to displays ponies giving messages in your terminal.<br/>
      It has a lot of features; you can use its <code>info</code> manual to explore it, the manual is also<br/>
      available <a href="./ponysay/index.html">[here]</a> or <a href="https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/blob/master/ponysay.pdf?raw=true">[here]</a> as an PDF. To the left you will found some recommended<br/>
      sections of the manual to read if you are not up for reading the entire manual.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot find a package distribute for your OS, take a look <a href="./ponysay/Package-repositories.html#Package-repositories">[here]</a> or build it yourself.<br/>
      On most systems with the base packages, base-devel packages and Python 3 installed,<br/>
      downloading the software and running <code>sudo ./setup.py --everything install</code><br/>
      should install ponysay, with everything it has to offer. If you are not privileged to run as<br/>
      super user you can install install it for just your user by omitting <code>sudo</code> and adding<br/>
      <code>--private</code>.<br/>
