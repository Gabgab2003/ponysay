      <code>ponysay</code> â€” a cowsay reimplemention for ponies
    </p>
    <p>
      ponysay as an awesome terminal application to display ponies speaking messages in your terminal.<br/>
      It has many features; you can use its <code>info</code> manual to explore them, the manual is <br/>
      available <b><a href="./ponysay/index.html">here</a></b> and <b><a href="https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/blob/master/ponysay.pdf?raw=true">here</a></b> as PDF. On the left you can find a few recommended<br/>
      sections of the manual to read, if you are not up for reading the entire manual.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot find a package for ponysay in your operating system's repositories, take a look <b><a href="./ponysay/Package-repositories.html#Package-repositories">here</a></b> or build it yourself.<br/>
      On most systems with the base and base-devel packages with Python 3 installed,<br/>
      downloading the software and running <code>sudo ./setup.py --everything install</code><br/>
      should suffice to install ponysay, complete with everything it has to offer. If you are not privileged to run as<br/>
      superuser you can install it only for your user by omitting <code>sudo</code> and appending<br/>
      <code>--private</code>.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are missing your favourite pony, <b><a href="https://github.com/erkin/ponysay/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open">ask</a></b> and we shall add it (as soon as possible).
