<h2 class="chapter">6 Pony metadata</h2>
<a name="index-pony-metadata"></a>
<a name="index-metadata"></a>
<a name="index-tags_002c-metadata"></a>
<a name="index-comments_002c-metadata"></a>
<a name="index-pony-tags_002c-metadata"></a>
<a name="index-pony-comments_002c-metadata"></a>

<p>Pony files can contain metadata tags and a multiline comment.
The following are the standard tags (comma separated lists may
have whitespace surrounding the comma [<code>,</code>]):
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><var>GROUP NAME</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-GROUP-NAME"></a>
<p>If a pony file contains multiple ponies, it <em>should</em> have a <var>GROUP NAME</var>
tag. The tag is a comma seperated list of the recognised names of the ponies as a
groups, if the list is empty the tag value must be <code>(none)</code>. An officiallity
tag should be added to each name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>NAME</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-NAME"></a>
<p>Every pony file should have this tag, one entry for each pony on the file.
The value of the tag <em>must</em> be the pony&rsquo;s most common name as used on
the TV show (or other source). If the pony&rsquo;s name have not been mentioned
the value must be <code>(not mentioned)</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>OTHER NAMES</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-OTHER-NAMES"></a>
<p>If a pony in the pony file has other names then the one in <var>NAME</var> it <em>should</em>
have this take for this pony. Any pony in the file (in case of multiple ponies) that
do not need this tag should use the value <code>(none)</code>.
</p>
<p>The tag is a comma seperated list of alternative (to <var>NAME</var> names for the pony,
each name should have an officiallity tag.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>APPEARANCE</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-APPEARANCE"></a>
<p>This tag specifies in which episode the pony first appeared. It reasonable to specify
it even for ponies that appears in every episode.
</p>
<p>For uniformity the format <code>S%sE%e %t[ %P]</code> is recommended; <code>[ ]</code> denotes
and optional part, optional in the sence that it does not apply the every episode,
but it <em>should</em> be used if applyable. <code>%s</code> is the series (season) number
in two digits, <code>%e</code> is the episode number in two digits. <code>%t</code> is the
episode title and should use the standardised title format for the used format
however without surrounding quotes if the used language has that, in the unlike
event that <code>[</code> or <code>]</code> is present in the title it should be backslashed
(<code>\[</code>, <code>\]</code>). <code>%P</code> is the part in the format <code>[Part %p]</code>, where
<code>[ ]</code> <i>does not</i> denote and optional part but rather is verbatim, and
<code>%p</code> is the part number in one digit (well, if the part number is not 10 or higher).
</p>
<p>The standard way to format titles in American English is the same as in British English,
however it is not fully standardised. Capitalisation of the first word, and all other words,
except for articles, prepositions, conjunctions, and forms of &lsquo;to be&rsquo; is recommended.
</p>
<p>Be aware that MLP:FiM episodes use American spelling which include a rather uncommon
why to write for examples abbrevations (like for example Mr. instread of Mr), this may
however not be the case for non-MLP:FiM episodes. And if there are not series (season)
the series number defaults to 1, however other numbers and tags (which the part number
is) may be added if required.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>KIND</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-KIND"></a>
<p>This tag decribes what kind of pony a pony is, it is a comma seperated lower case list,
and it cannot be empty, by it can be (but shouldn&rsquo;t) skipped for every pony in the image.
</p>
<p>Every fitting value should be used, however an alicorn (also known as alacorn, winged
unicorn, acorn, pegasus unicorn, unipeg, unisus, horned pegasus, wing-horn, allacorn,
cerapter pterippus, aquillacorn, pegasos aithiopikos alate unicorns,  or pegacorn)
should have the values <code>alicorn</code> and<code>pony</code>, but neither <code>pegasus</code> nor
<code>unicorn</code> or another of the possible therms mentioned. Earth ponies should have
the value <code>pony</code> and <code>earth</code> (not <code>earth pony</code>.)
</p>
<p>The standard values are (you may use other ones if fitting): <code>unicorn</code>, <code>pegasus</code>,
<code>alicorn</code>, <code>earth</code>, <code>pony</code>, <code>changeling</code>, <code>crystal</code>, <code>seapony</code>,
<code>animal</code> (applies to Spike) and <code>item</code> (applies to Tom and Pinkamina&rsquo;s imaginare friends.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>GROUP</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-GROUP"></a>

</li><li> <code>antagonist</code> (applies to: nightmare moon, gilda, discord, chrysalis)

Nightmare Moon, Discord and Chrysalis are such, but Gilda also counts as one.
</li><li> <code>deuteragonist</code> (applies to: the cutiemark cruisers)
Deuteragonists are secondary characters, these are (as of series 2) only the Cutiemark

Background characters are not characters that are neither protagonists, deuteragonist,
tritagonist, antagonist nor pets. They do not need to be strictly background characters,

</li></ul>

</dd>
<dt><var>BALLOON</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-BALLOON"></a>
<p>For each balloon in the file (a pony file can have more than one balloon, but
that is not common) their should one tag entry. There are four values that
can be used: <code>top</code> (the common setup, the balloon is at the top of the image),
<code>bottom</code> (the balloon is at the bottom of the image), <code>right</code> (the balloon
is neither at the top or at the bottom of the image, but is placed to the right of
the pony) and <code>inside</code> (the balloon is somewhere as inside the image.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>LINK ON</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-LINK-ON"></a>
<p>Files with only one pony <em>should not</em> use this tag. Specifies to which pony
the link is connected, it is a number, starting from 1.
</p>
<p>If a file contains Fluttershy and Pinkie (in that order, i.e. Pinkie is to the
right of or below Fluttershy) and the link is connected to Pinkie, than the value
should be 2.
</p>
<p>In the rare case that the file contains multiple links (and multi ponies), the
metadata should contains multiple entries of this tag, one entry for each link
sorted in the order of the linkes placement in the image, in the same way
ponies are ordered. 
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>LINK</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-LINK"></a>
<p>In the rare case that the file contains multiple links the metadata should contains
multiple entries of this tag, one entry for each link sorted in the order of the
linkes placement in the image, in the same way ponies are ordered. 
</p>
<p>The value for this tag must be either <code>regular</code> or <code>mirrored</code>. <code>regular</code>
applies to linkes with NNE–SSW (<code>\</code>) direction. <code>mirrored</code> applies to linkes
with NNW–SSE (<code>/</code>) direction, in version 2.9.1 only <samp>rainbowdrag</samp> uses this.

<dt><var>MANE</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-MANE"></a>
<p>The name of the colour (as best estimated by you), in lowercase, that the pony&rsquo;s mane

<dt><var>EYE</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-EYE"></a>
<p>The name of the colour (as best estimated by you), in lowercase, that the pony&rsquo;s eyes
have. Common colour names are preferable. Only one colour should be named, but the name

the ponies without magicial abilies should use the value <code>(no magic)</code>. If the pony
has magicial abilies but without an aura, use the value <code>(invisible)</code>.

A Canterlot Wedding].

should be specified in any reasonable manner.
</p>
<p>In order the claim authorship (the GitHub user value) it image must have been
written from scratch (using templates is okay) or must be a major edit of another

</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>FREE</var></dt>
<dd><a name="index-FREE"></a>

The value <em>must</em> either be <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>, or the tag must be omitted.
</p>
<p><b>This is the most important tag</b> as it helps us build a fully free version that can
be officially distributed on GNU endorsed GNU/Linux distributions (GNU/Linux-libre).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Duplicate tags should be ordered in the order of the pony they describe from top-left
to bottom-right in the image. It is important that if there are for example three ponies
the image then all used tags that depends on the number of ponies in the image is used
three times.
</p>
<a name="index-officiallity-tag"></a>
<p>&lsquo;Officiallity tag&rsquo; refers the an annotation added to a tag value&rsquo;s list element.
If the value is unofficial the string <code>(unofficial)</code> is appended (preferable with
leading whitespace) to the element. If it is official the appended string is of the
format <code>(official, %c)</code> (the brackets are verbatim), where <code>%c</code> is a
comment. For example Chrysalis&rsquo; name has not been mentioned in the show, however it
is used in the manuscript, therefore a pony file with Chrysalis should have the
(partial) metadata:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">NAME: (not mentioned)
OTHER NAMES: Chrysalis (official, in manuscript)
</pre></div>
