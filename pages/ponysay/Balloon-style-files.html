<p><a name="index-balloon-style-files-387"></a><a name="index-bubble-style-files-388"></a><a name="index-ponythink-389"></a>
Balloon style files are located in the directory <samp><span class="file">balloons/</span></samp>, the ones ending

   <p>Balloon style consists of 20 strings. Each string is defined on separate lines, by
their name and their value separated with a colon (<code>name:value</code>), if the name is
empty it continues the last one on a new line in the value. Only 10 of the strings
may be multi-lined: <var>nw</var>, <var>nnw</var>, <var>n</var>, <var>nne</var>, <var>ne</var>, <var>sw</var>,
<var>ssw</var>, <var>s</var>, <var>sse</var> and <var>se</var>.

   <p>The following strings are used, and must be defined in the files:
     <dl>
<dt><var>\</var><dd>The character for the link to the balloon directed as <code>\</code>. 
<br><dt><var>/</var><dd>The character for the link to the balloon directed as <code>/</code>.

contains only one line. 
<br><dt><var>nw</var><dd>The top left corner of the balloon.

printed directly to the right of the top left corner. 
<br><dt><var>n</var><dd>The top edge of the balloon. 
<br><dt><var>nne</var><dd>If both this string and the <var>nnw</var> string fits between the top corners, this is
