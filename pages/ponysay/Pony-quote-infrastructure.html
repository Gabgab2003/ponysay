<h3 class="section">10.2 Pony quote infrastructure</h3>

<p><a name="index-pony-quote-infrastructure-385"></a><a name="index-quote-infrastructure-386"></a>
When compiling, pony quotes are built to <samp><span class="file">quotes/</span></samp>, the file names are lists
of ponies joined with plus signs (<code>+</code>) &ndash; the pony names are the same as the
pony files, except they do not end with <samp><span class="file">.pony</span></samp> &ndash; with a index at the end,
and a full stop (<code>.</code>) before the index.

   <p>The source files are located in <samp><span class="file">ponyquotes/</span></samp>, where their is a file named
<samp><span class="file">ponies</span></samp>. This file is called the pony map, and is the basis for how the
compiled files are named. In the ponymap ponies with the same quotes are on the
same line join together with plus signs (<code>+</code>), if the lines because too long
for file names the line is split into multiple lines with the first pony in common.

   <p>In <samp><span class="file">ponyquotes/</span></samp> there are also quote files, each contain just one quote, just
as when compiled to <samp><span class="file">quotes/</span></samp>. The source quote files are identical to the
compiled quote files, except that their name contains just the first pony.
