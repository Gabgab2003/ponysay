<h3 class="section">11.1 Providing ponies</h3>

<p><a name="index-create-pony-file-412"></a>
Most pony images are browser ponies or desktop ponies, browser ponies is a port of
desktop ponies, implementing it in JavaScript. Browser ponies are available at
<a href="https://github.com/panzi/Browser-Ponies">https://github.com/panzi/Browser-Ponies</a>. Desktop ponies are available at
<a href="http://desktop-pony-team.deviantart.com/">http://desktop-pony-team.deviantart.com/</a>.

   <p>There is also a collection of ponies that are not yet pixelated in a Java
reimplementation of the early Ponysay:
<a href="https://github.com/maandree/unisay/tree/develop/dev/newponies">https://github.com/maandree/unisay/tree/develop/dev/newponies</a>

   <p>There is a checklist named <samp><span class="file">pony-checklist</span></samp> at the <samp><span class="file">dev/</span></samp> directory. You
can use the check which ponies are added and which are not. Please update it when fit. 
<br>

   <p>New ponies can be created from regular images by using util-say, which is available
at <a href="https://github.com/maandree/util-say">https://github.com/maandree/util-say</a>. 
Prior to version 2.1 of <samp><span class="command">ponysay</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">img2xterm</span></samp> could be used, by since
version 2.1 <samp><span class="command">ponysay</span></samp> is using a new format that only util-say supports. 
<samp><span class="command">img2xterm</span></samp> (<a href="https://github.com/rossy2401/img2xterm">https://github.com/rossy2401/img2xterm</a>) was used in the
early stage, but util-say tries to optimise the images in some aspects: as good as
possible for low capability terminals, tries to place the pony–balloon link, displayed
as good as possible when marked in the terminal (somewhat compromised by the first
aspect,) and same width on all rows.

   <p>Using util-say:
<a name="index-util_002dsay-413"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bimg2ponysay_007d-414"></a><p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="example">     <code>img2ponysay -2 -- SOURCE_IMAGE &gt; PONY_FILE</code>
     
     <code>PONY</code>_FILE should end with <samp><span class="file">.pony</span></samp> and be localed in <samp><span class="file">ponies/</span></samp>,
     or <samp><span class="file">extraponies/</span></samp> if the pony is not a MLP:FiM pony.
     
     Omit <samp><span class="option">-2</span></samp> if the source image does not use double pixel size.
     
     For more information see:
     <a href="https://github.com/maandree/util-say/wiki/img2ponysay">https://github.com/maandree/util-say/wiki/img2ponysay</a>

   </td></tr></table>

files as argument the for <samp><span class="command">ponysay -f</span></samp>, this requires that the file is named
<samp><span class="file">.png</span></samp> at the end.

   <p><a name="index-palette-420"></a><a name="index-xterm-palette-421"></a><a name="index-pony-palette-422"></a><a name="index-colour-palette-423"></a>The following <samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp> code will print the palette the ponies (the terminals)
use:
<p><table class="cartouche" summary="cartouche" border="1"><tr><td>
<pre class="example">     c=16
     while ((c &lt; 256)); do
         echo -en "\e[48;5;${c}m  \e[49m"
         c=$(( $c + 1 ))
         if (( $(( c % 36 )) == 16 )); then
             echo
         fi
     done; echo
</pre>
   </td></tr></table>

   <p><br>
For the palette to be correct, which is especially important when you draw ponies, you
must not redefine the colours in the range 16 to 255 (inclusive).

   <p><a name="index-ttypony-424"></a>When a pony is added please also add a ttypony version, i.e. the pony files used in
TTY, but if you don't please state so in the pull request so we do not miss the
create it; the simplest way to do this is to run <samp><span class="command">dev/dist.sh ttyponies</span></samp> after
adding the ponies to <samp><span class="file">ponies/</span></samp>, running <samp><span class="command">dev/dist.sh ttyponies</span></samp> will build
(or rebuild) all ttyponies with a pony present in <samp><span class="file">ponies/</span></samp>, and creates all
needed symlinks.

   <p>To be able to run <samp><span class="command">dev/dist.sh ttyponies</span></samp> you must have the packages listed under
<a href="Dependencies-for-pony-providers.html#Dependencies-for-pony-providers">Dependencies for pony providers</a>.

   <p><a name="index-ponyquotes-425"></a><a name="index-quotes-426"></a>Also when adding new ponies, please map them up in the file <samp><span class="file">ponyquotes/ponies</span></samp>. 
If the pony is a new pony without any other alternative image just add it to a new
line, without <samp><span class="file">.pony</span></samp>, preferably in its alphabetical position. If the file is
a symlink add it to the same line as the target pony, and if the pony has and
alternative image add it the the same line as that pony. Ponies on the same line are
separated with a plus sign (<code>+</code>) without any white space. When a line is too
long for a file name (this has happened to Pinkie Pie [<samp><span class="file">pinkie</span></samp>],) it must be
split into multiple lines, these lines should have their first pony file in common.
