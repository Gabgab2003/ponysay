<h3 class="section">10.1 Pony anatomy</h3>

<p><a name="index-pony-anatomy-383"></a><a name="index-anatomy-of-pony-files-384"></a>
The pony files are simple raw output data that can be printed to the terminal,
except it contains scalar variables. The pony images consists of white space, lower
half blocks [U+2584], upper half blocks [U+2580] and ANSI colour sequences (CSI m),
and, in TTY, colour value change sequences (OSI P).

   <p>Variables are recalled by putting the variable's name between two dollar signs
(<code>$var$</code>), and are stored by putting the variable's name followed by the value
between two dollar signs  and with a equality sign between the name and the value
(<code>$var=value$</code>). Variable names cannot include equality signs, but the value
can; dollar signs can be used by placing an ESC character before the dollar sign.

   <p>There are three predefined variables: <code>$$</code> (empty variable name), <code>$\$</code>
and <code>$/$</code>. <code>$$</code> has a dollar sign (<code>$</code>) as its value, while <code>$\$</code>
and <code>$/$</code> contains the characters for the link to the balloon directed in the
same direction as the variable name's slash.

   <p>Variables whose name begin with <code>balloon</code> are parsed as balloon inserts, it
can be either <code>balloon</code>, <code>balloonX</code>, <code>balloon,Y</code> or <code>balloonX,Y</code>,
whether <code>X</code> is the minimum width of the balloon and <code>Y</code> is the minimum
height of the balloon.

   <p>Prior to version 2.1 the pony files were cow files used by <samp><span class="command">cowsay</span></samp>, they
are partial Perl-scripts that assign a value to a scalar variable named
<var>$the_cow</var>. Cow files use a predefined scalar variable named <code>$thoughts</code>,
these are used to create a link between the message and the pony. The message (and
the balloon) itself was printed by <samp><span class="command">cowsay</span></samp> and is not defined in the cow
files.
